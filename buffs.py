# This file contains a list of buffs that may be provided to a gear set when simulating damage.

import numpy as np

# Simple list of buffs and their potencies.
# Currently incomplete and not necessarily in final form.

# Format is [Base, Bonus].
# For Example: GEO Acumen uses [15,3]. So with +6 geomancy, it would be Base+Bonus*6 = 15+3*6 Magic Attack with Acumen
