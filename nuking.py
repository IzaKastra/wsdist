    #
    # Calculate the magic accuracy obtained from player stats vs enemy stats.
    #
    #   Note: BG Wiki states that Ninjutsu magic accuracy does not have a dSTAT term.
    #         "Ninjutsu accuracy is not affected by any dSTAT"
    #   I believe BG Wiki is incorrect and that Ninjutsu uses dINT for magic accuracy as well as damage. My reasoning is:
    #     1) The BG Wiki page for Ninjutsu is already known to be incorrect, stating
    #           "Ninjutsu have a unified V value based on tier levels, all elemental Ninjustus have the same V at the same tiers."
    #           "Like V, Ninjutsu have a unified M value not based on Î”INT ranges, but on tier level."
    #        I've already demonstrated that [M,V] changes with dINT, proving that BG Wiki is incorrect.
    #        See my testing on ffxiah: https://www.ffxiah.com/forum/topic/56749/updated-ninjutsu-damage-formulae/
    #     2) Consider other forms of magic damage:
    #            Black Magic damage and accuracy change with dINT
    #            White Magic damage and accuracy change with dMND
    #            Ninjutsu damage changes with dINT.
    #        Thus it makes sense that Ninjutsu magic accuracy also changes with dINT. I assume the functional form is identical to the other forms of magic accuracy from dSTAT.
    #     3) Ninjutsu not having any dSTAT accuracy term would be a huge magic accuracy loss that is not observed in game.
    #        This means that Ninjutsu MUST have a huge hidden magic accuracy bonus or it simply follows the same dSTAT formula as other magic damage.
    #        Since dINT affects Ninjutsu damage, I assume that dINT also affects Ninjutsu magic accuracy
    #
    #
    # The process for estimating Magic Accuracy from STAT is not explained well on the BG Wiki page...
    # The JP blog (auto translated: https://luteff11.livedoor.blog/archives/49725347.html) is pretty clear.
