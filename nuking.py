    #
    # Calculate the magic accuracy obtained from player stats vs enemy stats.
    #
    #   Note: BG Wiki states that Ninjutsu magic accuracy does not have a dSTAT term.
    #         "Ninjutsu accuracy is not affected by any dSTAT"
    #   I believe BG Wiki is incorrect and that Ninjutsu uses dINT for magic accuracy as well as damage. My reasoning is:
    #     1) The BG Wiki page for Ninjutsu is already known to be incorrect, stating
    #           "Ninjutsu have a unified V value based on tier levels, all elemental Ninjustus have the same V at the same tiers."
    #           "Like V, Ninjutsu have a unified M value not based on Î”INT ranges, but on tier level."
    #        I've already demonstrated that [M,V] changes with dINT, proving that BG Wiki is incorrect.
    #        See my testing on ffxiah: https://www.ffxiah.com/forum/topic/56749/updated-ninjutsu-damage-formulae/
    #     2) Consider other forms of magic damage:
    #            Black Magic damage and accuracy change with dINT
    #            White Magic damage and accuracy change with dMND
    #            Ninjutsu damage changes with dINT.
    #        Thus it makes sense that Ninjutsu magic accuracy also changes with dINT. I assume the functional form is identical to the other forms of magic accuracy from dSTAT.
    #     3) Ninjutsu not having any dSTAT accuracy term would be a huge magic accuracy loss that is not observed in game.
    #        This means that Ninjutsu MUST have a huge hidden magic accuracy bonus or it simply follows the same dSTAT formula as other magic damage.
    #        Since dINT affects Ninjutsu damage, I assume that dINT also affects Ninjutsu magic accuracy
    #
    #
    # The process for estimating Magic Accuracy from STAT is not explained well on the BG Wiki page...
    # My interpretation is:
    #
    # Consider the equation of a straight line:
    # 
    #     y = m*x + b
    # or
    #     MAcc_stat = m*dSTAT + b
    #
    # BG Wiki gives the slope (m) for various dSTAT ranges, but has no mention of the y-intercept (b) for these ranges.
    # BG instead provides a CHANGE in MAcc caused by a CHANGE in dSTAT. This is a derivative, so we need the derivative of the straight-line equation to relate it to BG Wiki:
    #
    #     dy = m*dx   (assuming m and b are constants)
    #
    # Now I assume that this derivative formula has an additional reasonable boundary condition:
    #
    #     y(0) = 0 
    #    (Magic Accuracy from STAT is +0 when the player has exactly 0 STAT total)
    #
    # This suggests that b = 0 for the first dSTAT range (up to dSTAT=10).
    # This is the only b value that matters for our purposes, but we could use derivative boundary conditions to derive exact formulae for y=mx+b in all ranges if we wanted to.
    #
    # We can now write a simple formula relating magic_accuracy to player_stat, enemy_stat, and m for various dSTAT ranges:
    #
    #     MAcc = 1.00*min(Enemy_INT+10, Player_INT) + 
    #            0.50*min((Enemy_INT+30)-(Enemy_INT+10), Player_INT-(Enemy_INT+10)) + 
    #            0.25*min((Enemy_INT+70)-(Enemy_INT+30), Player_INT-(Enemy_INT+30))
    #
    # As an example, consider player_INT = 254 and enemy_INT = 217.
    # 1) dINT = +37, so we need to sum the contribution from the dINT<=10 range, the dINT<=30 range, and the partial dINT<=70 range.
    # 2) dINT = 10 when player_INT = enemy_INT+10 = 227, so we gain +227 Magic Accuracy from this first dINT range just for having dINT>10
    # 3) dINT = 30 when player_INT = enemy_INT+30, but we need to subtract off the dINT<10 range or we'll double count it.
    #    This leaves Player_INT-(Enemy_INT+10) <= 20 dINT contributing to Magic Accuracy in this range. Since we have dINT=+37, we use the full 20 in this range.
    #    m=0.5 in this range, so total magic accuracy gained is 20*0.5 = 10
    # 4) Now dINT = 70 when player_INT = enemy_INT+70 = 287, which is higher than our player_INT; only a portion of our remaining INT contributes in this range
    #    Again, we need to remove the contribution from the previous dINT ranges to avoid double-counting them
    #    This leaves Player_INT-(Enemy_INT+30) <= 40 contributing in this range.
    #    In our case, we only have 254 INT, so only 254 - 217+30 = 7 of our INT contributes to this range
    #    m=0.25 for this dINT range, so we have 7*0.25 = +1.75 Magic Accuracy in the final dINT range
    #
    # 5) Adding all of these together, we get 227 + 10 + 1.75 = +238.75 Magic Accuracy from dINT alone
    # 6) This should probably be truncated, so we have +238 Magic Accuracy total from dINT alone.
    # 
    # This gets added to Magic Accuracy, <Ninjutsu> Skill, and Magic Accuracy Skill to determine Magic Hit Rate, which gives resist states later.
    #
    # As an extreme example, if we had infinite INT, then the maximum possible Magic Accuracy gained from STAT is determined entirely from the enemy_INT:
    #
    #     dstat_macc = 1.00*(enemy_stat+10) + 0.5*20 + 0.25*40
    #                = enemy_stat + 30
    #
    # For enemy_stat = 293, the maximum Magic Accuracy we could obtain from STAT would be 293+30 = 323 as long as we had dSTAT>70
    #
    dstat_macc = 1.00*max(0,min(enemy_stat+10, player_stat)) + \
                 0.50*max(0,min((enemy_stat+30)-(enemy_stat+10), player_stat-(enemy_stat+10))) + \
                 0.25*max(0,min((enemy_stat+70)-(enemy_stat+30), player_stat-(enemy_stat+30)))
